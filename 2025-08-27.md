## üñ•Ô∏è What I worked on

- Built a heart icon in HTML
- Built a video compilation HTML page

## üìì Key lessons

- ==Audio== element uses same syntax as ==a==
	- Use ==controls== attribute to display play/pause/restart
	- Use ==loop== attribute to auto loop audio
	- Use ==muted== attribute to auto mute audio
	- Can use ==source== element for the browser to select the audio type it understands
```
<audio
  src="..."
  loop
  controls
  muted
></audio>

<audio controls>
  <source src="___.mp3" type="audio/mp3"
</audio>
```
- ==Video== element uses same syntax as ==audio==, but you can also add a thumbnail with ==poster== attribute
```
<video
  src="..."
  loop
  controls
  muted
  poster="..."
  width="..."
></video>
```
- Can use SVGs directly in HTML with ==svg== element because of XML data
- Use ==iframe== element to embed external websites
	- Use ==srcdoc== attribute instead of ==src== to embed direct HTML
```
<iframe
  src="..."
  title="..."
  height="..."
  width="..."
  style="border: 1px solid black"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```
- Important values for ==target== attribute:
	- Use ==self== to open link in current tab
	- Use ==blank== to open link in new tab
	- Use ==parent== to open link in parent frame (will open in current tab if no parent detected)
	- Use ==top== to open link in highest level parent frame
- Use absolute paths when linking to external resources or to internal resources that need to work no matter the document location within the site
- Use relative paths when linking to internal resources, during local testing or for cleaner/easier to maintain code

> [!myimportant] File path syntax
> / and \ = path separator
> . = current directory
> .. = parent directory

- Use link states to customise link appearance when interacted with
```
:link <!-- Default state -->
:visited
:hover
:focus <!-- That border that appears on buttons/links when you press Tab -->
:active <!-- When clicked on -->
```
- Use ==div== as a container for other elements ‚Üí **it has no semantic meaning**
```
<div>
  <h1>...</h1>
  <p>...</p>
</div>
```

> [!myimportant] 
> We don‚Äôt focus on style in HTML anymore (‚Äúpresentational HTML‚Äù). Instead, we link to CSS elements and use ‚Äúsemantic HTML,‚Äù hence why we don‚Äôt turn something into a header just to make it bold and bigger, for example.

- Use ==nav== element to incorporate navigation links
- Text emphasis:
	- Use ==i== element to indicate that text differs from its surroundings %%just style%%
	- Use ==em== element to indicate a stress emphasis on text %%style with meaning%%
	- Use ==b== element to bring attention to text %%just style%%
	- Use ==strong== element to indicate that text is crucial/urgent %%style with meaning%%
	- Use ==u== element to indicate that text has non-textual annotations applied (e.g. misspelled words) %%style with meaning%%
	- Use ==s== element to indicate that text is no longer accurate/relevant %%style with meaning%%
	- Use¬†==del==¬†and¬†==ins==¬†elements for doc edits (not s) %%just style%%
```
<p><i>Rosalyne</i> was my first original character.</p>

<p>This is the <em>best</em> book I have ever read.</p>

<p><strong>REMINDER:</strong> Do not sleep less than 7-8 hours.</p>
```
- Use ==cite== element to indicate that text is a referenced creative work
```
<p>Have you read <cite>Demian: Die Geschichte einer Jugend von Emil Sinclair</cite> by Hermann Hesse?</p>
```
- Use ==blockquote== element to indicate that text is a quote + ==cite== attribute to link the source
```
<blockquote cite="https://www.christies.com/en/stories/fabienne-verdier-studio-visit-45dd4b732ebd4d73906c15c97d5e437b"
  "I have all these forms in my brain, in my bones, in my blood. Painting just made me understand it."
</blockquote>
```
- Use ==dl== element (description lists) to create dictionaries/glossaries
```
<dl>
  <dt>TERM</dt>
  <dd>DEFINITION</dd>
</dl>
```

## ‚úñÔ∏è Bugs or blockers

- I forgot to add iframe end tag when building the video compilation HTML page because I thought it used the same syntax as ==img==
- I didn‚Äôt really get the difference between ==i==/==em== and ==b==/==strong== elements until I made the distinction between presentational and semantic HTML.
