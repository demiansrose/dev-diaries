## ‚úîÔ∏è Tasks

- [x] Complete Cod√©dex Python chapter 4
- [x] Download Python cheat sheet
- [x] Complete Cod√©dex SQL chapter 1
- [x] Complete Cod√©dex SQL chapter 2

## üñ•Ô∏è What I worked on

- Created a program to find multiples
- Created a roll-a-dice program
- Created a program to sum the squares of a sequence of numbers

## üìì Key lessons

- Use the ==while()== function to iterate as long as condition is true
- Use the ==range(start, stop, step)== function to iterate a certain number of times %%cf. cours maths suites%%
	- **Start:** starts at provided number
	- **Stop:** stops before provided number
	- **Step:** default interval of 1
- Use the % operator to find multiples
```
num % [MULTIPLE] == 0
```
- Use SELECT DISTINCT to select only unique values
- Use LIKE to search for patterns in WHERE statements
	- **X%:** starts with $x$
	- **%X:** ends with $x$
	- **%X%:** contains $x$
- Use BETWEEN $x$ AND $y$ to search range
- Use ORDER BY [COLUMN] asc/desc + GROUP BY to categorise
- Use aggregate functions after SELECT + use asterisk to return function applied to rows
```
SELECT language, COUNT(language)
FROM games
GROUP BY language
```

## ‚úñÔ∏è Bugs or blockers

- **Roll-a-dice:** Put the random number generation inside the loop + the total variable before
```
total = 0
while total != 2:
  dice1 = random.randint(0, 6)
  dice2 = random.randint(0, 6)
  total = dice1 + dice2
  if total != 2:
    print('Nope')
  else:
    print('Snake eyes')
```
- Use +1 in the range() function to increment when the stop number is asked
```
number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
total = 0
for i in range(1, number + 1):
  square = i ** 2
  total += square
```
