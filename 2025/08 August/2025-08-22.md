I’ve started FreeCodeCamp’s Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum, and I’m really enjoying it so far.

They have bite-sized lectures that focus on one concept at a time with a quiz at the end and lots of exercises throughout each chapter. They have what they call “workshops” and “labs”.

Workshops take you more by the hand by giving you very detailed step-by-step instructions to make sure you’re understanding the concepts you’re applying.

Labs, on the other hand, give you a list of elements to incorporate into your code and a rendered overview of what you’ll build, but they encourage you to customise the contents as much as possible to test your skills.

## ✔️ Tasks

- [x] Complete FreeCodeCamp HTML attributes lesson

## 🖥️ What I worked on

- Debugged HTML pages by reviewing code

## 📓 Key lessons

- Store the site’s metadata in a *head* section (character set, name, size, meta title/description, favicon, etc.)
- Use *link* element to link to external resources (stylesheets, site icons) inside the *head* element
- Use “./“ in *href* to tell the computer to look in the current folder for the reference
```
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Examples of the link element</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
</head>
```
- Use *input* element to collect data from users
```
<input type="checkbox" checked>
```
- Use *preconnect* value for *rel* attribute to create an early connection to value specified in *href* attribute (e.g. for fonts) → *speeds ↗ loading time*
```
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playwrite+CU:wght@100..400&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
>
```
- Use *icon* value for *rel* attribute to link to icons
```
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
```
