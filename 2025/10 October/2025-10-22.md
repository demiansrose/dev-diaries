## ✔️ Tasks

- [x] Complete FreeCodeCamp CSS greeting card workshop
- [x] Complete FreeCodeCamp Python introduction lesson

## 🖥️ What I worked on

- Built a birthday card with blocks/buttons that transition to another colour when you hover over them

## 📓 Key lessons

- _Print_ functon arguments:
  - **objects:** Data to print
sep=' ': The separator between the objects. This defaults to a single space character (' ').
end='\n': What to print at the end of the object. This defaults to a new line character ('\n').
file=sys.stdout: Determines where to send the output. The default is the terminal, but it can be a file.
flush=False: Determines whether to show the output data right away. The default is False, which means Python may wait before displaying the output.
```
print(objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```
