## 📓 Key lessons

- **Tree-structural pseudo-classes:** target + style elements based on position within current document
  - _Root, empty, nth-child(n), nth-last-child(n), first-child, last-child, only-child, nth-of-type, first-of-type, last-of-type, only-of-type_
  - n = number or keyword (e.g., odd, even)
- **Functional pseudo-classes:** select elements based on complex conditions/relationships
  - _Is(), where(), has(), not()_
- **Pseudo-elements:** style specific parts of element or insert content without adding extra HTML
  - _Before, after, first-letter, marker, placeholder, spelling-error, selection, etc._
  - marker = list item marker styling
