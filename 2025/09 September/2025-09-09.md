## ✔️ Tasks

- [x] Complete FreeCodeCamp CSS cafe menu workshop

## 🖥️ What I worked on

- Built a cafe menu in HTML + CSS

## 📓 Key lessons

- The _address_ element is italic by default
- Use _a_ selector + pseudo-classes (:hover, :visited, etc.) in CSS to change link colour
```
  a:visited {
    color: grey;
  }
```
- Headers have default margins that you can remove by adding a _margin_ property set to 0
- Use _margin: auto_ to center block elements
```
  img {
    display: block;
    margin: auto;
  }
```
- Use _margin-top_ property with a negative value to move the element up regardless of the above element's margins (e.g. an image below a header)
