## 🖥️ What I worked on

- Designed a business card with basic CSS like color, font size, and text-align properties

## 📓 Key lessons

- Use _text-decoration: none_ for link styling to remove default underline
- **Pseudo-classes:** 1 colon (e.g., ":hover")
- **Pseudo-elements:** 2 colons (e.g., "::before")
- **Universal selector:** asterisk (*)
- **CSS specificity:** CSS algorithm that determines the order in which styles are applied
  - **A-level (1, 0, 0, 0):** inline styles
  - **B-level (0, 1, 0, 0):** IDs
  - **C-level (0, 0, 1, 0):** classes, attributes, pseudo-classes
  - **D-level (0, 0, 0, 1):** elements/types, pseudo-elements
- Use _!important_ keyword in CSS to override inline styles or third-party libraries/frameworks → **to use sparringly because it breaks the natural cascading of styles**
```
p {
  background-color: black !important;
}
```
- Cascade algorithm determines the order in which rules are applied → **relevance > origin & importance > specificity > order of appearance**
- CSS properties can be inherited from parent element (e.g., color, font family, line height)
- Not inherited properties (e.g. margin, padding, background border) can be set either directly in child element or by using _inherent_ value
```
p {
  padding: inherent;
}
```
- How to space out items:
  - Use _line-height_ property to customise spacing between lines of text within lists → **can impact other elements if used on single lines**
  - Use _margin-bottom_/_padding-bottom_ to space out individuals elements
- Use _list-style_ property to customise lists
  - Use _list-style-type_ to choose between bullet points and numbers
  - Use _list-style-position_ to indicate whether the list item marker sits inside or outside the content
  - Use _list-style-image_ to use images as bullet points
  - You can combine all 3 by listing their values inside _list-style_
