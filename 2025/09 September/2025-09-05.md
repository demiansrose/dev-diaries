## ✔️ Tasks

- [x] Start FreeCodeCamp CSS cafe menu workshop

## 🖥️ What I worked on

- Designed a simple cafe menu with an image background, icons, and different text alignments

## 📓 Key lessons

- Use _/* */_ to add comments in CSS
- Use _url: (LINK)_ value to retrieve media
```
body {
  background-image: url("black-stars.png");
}
```
- If you want to put 2 paragraphs on the same line:
  - Put _p_ element on the same line
  - Add different classes to each _p_
  - Add _width_ property to both classes with values adding up to 100% (e.g. 75% for one + 25% for the other)
  - Put both _p_ in a parent element
  - Add _display_ property to parent of class with value set to _inline-block_
- You can add a fallback value to properties in case the initial value can't be found
```
body {
  font-family: garamond, serif;
}
```

## ✖️ Bugs or blockers

- I forgot to link the CSS stylesheet in the HTML file.
