## ‚úîÔ∏è Tasks

- [x] Complete Cod√©dex Python chapter 1
- [x] Complete Cod√©dex Python chapter 2
- [x] Complete Cod√©dex Python chapter 3

## üñ•Ô∏è What I worked on

- Created basic programs for: pH levels, BMI, Pythagorean theorem, temperature and currency converter, Magic 8 Ball
- Created a quiz to determine which Harry Potter house the user belongs to

## üìì Key lessons

- For a personality-type quiz, it‚Äôs better to set a dictionary rather than variables
```
houses = {
  "Hufflepuff": 0,
  "Slytherin": 0,
  "Ravenclaw": 0,
  "Gryffindor": 0
}
```
- Use += to increment and -= to decrement
```
if answer == 1:
  houses["Gryffindor"] +=1
  houses["Ravenclaw"] +=1
```
- Using loops to print out the results is more effective (you don‚Äôt have to retype each variable)
```
print("Here are your results")
for house, points in houses.items(): # house takes the key, points takes the value
  print(f"{house}: {points} points")
```
- Use the *get()** function to retrieve the key of a value
```
user_house = max(houses, key=houses.get)
print(f"You are a {user_house}!")
```
- Use *random.randint()* to randomly generate a number
```
import random

grade = random.randint(0, 100)
print(f"{grade}/100")

if grade >= 55:
  print("You passed.")
else:
  print("You failed.")
```
- Use *random.choice()* to choose an item from a list
```
import random

question = input("Question: ")

answer_list = ["Yes - definitely.", "It is decidedly so.", "Without a doubt.", "Reply hazy, try again.", "Ask again later.", "Better not tell you now.", "My sources say no.", "Outlook not so good.", "Very doubtful."]

answer = random.choice(answer_list)

print(f"Magic 8 Ball: {answer}")
```

## ‚úñÔ∏è Bugs or blockers

- Putting multiple increments/decrements in a single line causes a syntax error since they are statements, which requires them to have their own line
```
if answer == 1:
¬† gryffindor +=1 and ravenclaw +=1

File "/home/main.py", line 2 gryffindor +=1 and ravenclaw +=1
                                        ^                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
